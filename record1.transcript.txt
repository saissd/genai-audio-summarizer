It's a fun journey, especially if you are new if this is your second or third time around you will be continue to grow In your skills as well. My name is Anil Thomas. I'm the head of AI engineering and innovation here at PMA. This company was started by Dr. Nancy Lee She's the CEO founder came up with this idea and brought together kind of a wide array of tools to bring this to fruition The goal of this project this whole cohort is to gain Experience in AI ML the development life cycle as well as what does an HL agile methodology look like and to really get hands-on experience What we're gonna learn kind of throughout this whole program is it's an 11-week program It's a project base structure with Identifying actual user pain points. So the designers and the product manager will go out and actually Interview potential stakeholders. It could be B to B or B to C finding out Is it rather than just a being an idea? How are they solving the pain point today isn't a real pain point and is this something that we can really work on? The learning objective is to build an AI solution in the real world in a project-based setting to explore and exploit Gen AI tools and framework and then to deliver a feature rich minimal viable based product based on predetermined success On this journey, you'll kind of learn through technical skill development core AI ML concepts gen AI and data engineering Project-based learning as well so agile spray methodology scrum methodology team collaborations and real-world applications If you look at the chat that I just put some details I'll go over that in a little bit But that has some of the documentation in regard to some of the training both from a document perspective as well as a YouTube Playlist for the engineers and the designers and data scientists So I want to talk through the timelines a little bit make sure that we're all kind of on the same page So we are starting this week So this is considered week one from the 15 through the 21st throughout this from the designers and the engineers standpoint There will be some training documentation that the designer should review as well as the agile methodology For the engineers and data scientists also training in AI concepts So looking at the documentation start reviewing the YouTube playlist as well as agile methodology understanding the framework for the engineers as well There's gonna be an assignment from week one to three It'll be a job tracker Agent or a discord FAQ chatbot or it'll be a team assignment Basically that team assignment is helping out with an existing team from a previous cohort Which is already started the development process, but they're continuing to build So we'll be looking based on some of your skill sets if that's an opportunity as well Then for next week week two there'll be pitch day that'll be roughly September 16th That's really for the product managers and the designers so the product managers next week You will be pitching your idea to the designers and The designers will have a team match spreadsheet that you will fill out Kind of explaining which one of those you're interested in and then the designers and the product manager should kind of reach out to each other via discord to kind of have a conversation which Right which team individual would be the right match So we are looking for right now two designers roughly to start off for each AI product team And it would be kind of a senior designer and a junior designer for a specific AI product team While that's happening the engineers are continuing to work on the the assignment the job tracker the discord FAQ Or if you're allocated to a team and continuing your learning process So one of the things for the product managers and designers Make sure that you have a calendar invite for september 16th If not, let marla or myself know via email or discord and we'll make sure that you have the respective calendar invite for that day Then for the designers after the pitch day is done and you are part of a team Now you are actually helping the product managers going through the interview process going out looking at what does the real world How are they managing the issue currently? What are the best ways that you know, you could potentially resolve this and you'll work through that Also, you'll be working on a high fidelity Layout so that week four will be the the pitch day where the product managers and the designers will be pitching to the engineers and data scientists While that's occurring week three continuing the engineers and data scientists are continuing to work on their assignments Then pitch day that's week four That's the the bigger pitch day where the like I mentioned the product managers and the designers are pitching to all of the engineers It'll be a zoom call just like this. All of these pitch days are zoom calls that are also recorded Everyone should verify that you have a calendar invite for october 7th And once that pitch day is done the engineers and data scientists will fill out a google form Where you'll rank your top three AI products based on the pitch Also, if you're willing to be a lead engineer From your role and what you selected within your top three I will then determine Which one of the top three that you've chosen you'll be a part of and that's what you'll work on continuing forward There are some product managers that have only signed up for the first four weeks So you'll be a part of this first four-week process and then a few product managers will kind of drop off For the others that are continuing from the building standpoint will then keep going Now, let me talk a little bit more about what the match process looks like. So like I mentioned week two september 20
