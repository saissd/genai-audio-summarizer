1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:07,590
It's a fun journey, especially if you are new if this is your second or third time around you will be continue to grow

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,890
In your skills as well. My name is Anil Thomas. I'm the head of

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:18,290
AI engineering and innovation here at PMA. This company was started by Dr. Nancy Lee

4
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:23,250
She's the CEO founder came up with this idea and brought together kind of a wide array of tools to bring this to fruition

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,950
The goal of this project this whole cohort is to gain

6
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:33,190
Experience in AI ML the development life cycle as well as what does an HL agile methodology look like and to really get hands-on experience

7
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,470
What we're gonna learn kind of throughout this whole program is it's an 11-week program

8
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,550
It's a project base structure with

9
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,630
Identifying actual user pain points. So the designers and the product manager will go out and actually

10
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,870
Interview potential stakeholders. It could be B to B or B to C finding out

11
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,590
Is it rather than just a being an idea?

12
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,750
How are they solving the pain point today isn't a real pain point and is this something that we can really work on?

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,950
The learning objective is to build an AI solution in the real world in a project-based setting to explore and exploit

14
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:10,470
Gen AI tools and framework and then to deliver a feature rich minimal viable based product based on predetermined success

15
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:18,070
On this journey, you'll kind of learn through technical skill development core AI ML concepts gen AI and data engineering

16
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:23,950
Project-based learning as well so agile spray methodology scrum methodology team collaborations and real-world applications

17
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,210
If you look at the chat that I just put some details

18
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,590
I'll go over that in a little bit

19
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,110
But that has some of the documentation in regard to some of the training both from a document perspective as well as a YouTube

20
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,190
Playlist for the engineers and the designers and data scientists

21
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,230
So I want to talk through the timelines a little bit make sure that we're all kind of on the same page

22
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,470
So we are starting this week

23
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:51,310
So this is considered week one from the 15 through the 21st throughout this from the designers and the engineers standpoint

24
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:57,750
There will be some training documentation that the designer should review as well as the agile methodology

25
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,310
For the engineers and data scientists also training in AI concepts

26
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:10,230
So looking at the documentation start reviewing the YouTube playlist as well as agile methodology understanding the framework for the engineers as well

27
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,230
There's gonna be an assignment from week one to three

28
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,310
It'll be a job tracker

29
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,830
Agent or a discord FAQ chatbot or it'll be a team assignment

30
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,550
Basically that team assignment is helping out with an existing team from a previous cohort

31
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,230
Which is already started the development process, but they're continuing to build

32
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,190
So we'll be looking based on some of your skill sets if that's an opportunity as well

33
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:37,270
Then for next week week two there'll be pitch day that'll be roughly September 16th

34
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,310
That's really for the product managers and the designers so the product managers next week

35
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,270
You will be pitching your idea to the designers and

36
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,470
The designers will have a team match spreadsheet that you will fill out

37
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,390
Kind of explaining which one of those you're interested in and then the designers and the product manager should kind of reach out to each other

38
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,870
via discord to kind of have a conversation which

39
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,910
Right which team individual would be the right match

40
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:05,590
So we are looking for right now two designers roughly to start off for each AI product team

41
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,550
And it would be kind of a senior designer and a junior designer for a specific AI product team

42
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:17,110
While that's happening the engineers are continuing to work on the the assignment the job tracker the discord FAQ

43
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,630
Or if you're allocated to a team and continuing your learning process

44
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,910
So one of the things for the product managers and designers

45
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,110
Make sure that you have a calendar invite for september 16th

46
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:34,630
If not, let marla or myself know via email or discord and we'll make sure that you have the respective calendar invite for that day

47
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,370
Then for the designers after the pitch day is done and you are part of a team

48
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:46,530
Now you are actually helping the product managers going through the interview process going out looking at what does the real world

49
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,610
How are they managing the issue currently?

50
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,490
What are the best ways that you know, you could potentially resolve this and you'll work through that

51
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,890
Also, you'll be working on a high fidelity

52
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:03,250
Layout so that week four will be the the pitch day where the product managers and the designers will be pitching to the engineers and data scientists

53
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:09,810
While that's occurring week three continuing the engineers and data scientists are continuing to work on their assignments

54
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,490
Then pitch day that's week four

55
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,090
That's the the bigger pitch day where the like I mentioned the product managers and the designers are pitching to all of the engineers

56
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,570
It'll be a zoom call just like this. All of these pitch days are zoom calls that are also recorded

57
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,890
Everyone should verify that you have a calendar invite for october 7th

58
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,570
And once that pitch day is done the engineers and data scientists will fill out a google form

59
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,690
Where you'll rank your top three AI products based on the pitch

60
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,250
Also, if you're willing to be a lead engineer

61
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,450
From your role and what you selected within your top three

62
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,130
I will then determine

63
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,690
Which one of the top three that you've chosen you'll be a part of and that's what you'll work on continuing forward

64
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,130
There are some product managers that have only signed up for the first four weeks

65
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,250
So you'll be a part of this first four-week process and then a few product managers will kind of drop off

66
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,210
For the others that are continuing from the building standpoint will then keep going

67
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:08,850
Now, let me talk a little bit more about what the match process looks like. So like I mentioned week two september 20
